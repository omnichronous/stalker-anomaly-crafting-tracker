Jerrycans were brought to the Zone in large quantities by the Ukrainian military for their armoured vehicles. Initially, they served their purpose, but after the second Chernobyl Disaster vehicles for reasons still unknown were no longer operational. While some Zoners are still trying to make the wrecks work again, others have found alternate ways of utilising the jerrycans, namely, as improvised explosives. Upon direct hit, the canister will catch fire and explode after a slight delay. Although heavy and cumbersome, it is extremely powerful, and a well-placed jerrycan can be lethal even if the target wears the heaviest of body armours. On the other hand, the explosion is often so potent that the killer becomes the victim himself, so it's best to use these canisters with caution. There are rumours that a veteran stalker named Yuya once saved his skin by luring a pseudogiant into a jerrycan trap.

I met with the Barkeep, he says he sent Duty scouts to get into the underground vaults of the Dark Valley, called X-18, but they disappeared. There are another rumours regarding a 'psi-brain' mechanism. The whole neighbourhood in Yantar is under the influence of that piece of trash: it zombified everyone who came within range.
